            U.S. Veterans, their family members or others may have been exposed to contaminated
            drinking water between 1953 and 1987 at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and developed
            cancer or other serious health issues years later. Some of these servicemen, families or
            thers present at the base have been deemed ineligible or had their claims denied by the
            Veterans Administration, but a new law may allow them compensation.
